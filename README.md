# Overview of Election Audit: 
The purpose of this project was to complete an election audit for a local congressional election. The following tasks included:

## Election-Audit Summary: 
The code can be adjusted to find the most number of votes for different categories other than candidates and county. If the data we had included other categories such as demographics and geography. Adding these categories gcould let you further know which gender casted more votes or even which gender casted as well as their counties together to know which genders cast more votes.
This script can also be modified to determine patterns among the categories. We could check the percentage of voters by county against each candidate as well as which gender votes for which candidate more. This would allow us to see which candidate was the most popular within a county or geographical area.
